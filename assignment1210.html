<h1>Staying Safe Online: Understanding Privacy, Security, and Ethics as a Student</h1>

<p>
As a student, communication technology is a big part of my daily life. I use my phone and laptop every day for schoolwork,
entertainment, and staying connected with friends and family. I submit assignments online, check announcements through
school platforms, and use social media to relax during my free time.
</p>

<p>
Because technology is so common, it is easy to forget that there are many risks involved in using it. Privacy, security,
and ethical issues are problems that students face every day, even if they do not always notice them.
</p>

<h2>Privacy and Security Issues</h2>

The lock symbol shows how data such as messages, photos, and login details should be kept secure.
As students use social media, messaging apps, and online learning platforms every day, protecting privacy is no longer optional.
This image helps remind users that strong passwords, privacy settings, and careful online behavior are necessary to stay safe.

<h3>Security Threats: Phishing and Online Scams</h3>

<p>
Security threats are extremely common in communication technologies. Research shows that 
<strong>approximately 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent every day worldwide</strong>, making phishing one of the most common cyber threats.
These emails often target students by pretending to be schools, delivery services, or popular websites.

<p>
Google also reports blocking <strong>around 100 million phishing emails every day</strong> in order to protect users from scams.
This highlights how widespread and serious online security risks have become.

<h3>Social Media Risks and Cyberbullying</h3>

<p>
Online communication can also cause emotional and social harm. According to Statistics Canada,
<strong>1 in 4 teens aged 12 to 17 reported experiencing cyberbullying in the past year</strong>.
This shows that online platforms can create serious negative experiences for young people.

</p>


<p>
One major issue related to communication technology is privacy. Many websites and apps collect personal information from
users, including names, email addresses, locations, and browsing history. Most users accept terms and conditions without
reading them, which means they may not realize how much information is being shared.
</p>

<p>
Location tracking is a common privacy issue. Some apps track users even when the app is not open. This data can be used for
advertising or shared with third-party companies. I did not realize how many apps had access to my location until I checked
my phone settings.
</p>

<p>
Security issues are also very common. Phishing scams often appear as emails or messages that look official, such as messages
pretending to be from a school or delivery service. If users click the link and enter their information, their accounts
can be hacked.
</p>

<p>
Data breaches show that no online system is completely safe. Even large companies have experienced data leaks. Students can
protect themselves by using strong passwords, avoiding password reuse, and enabling two-factor authentication.
</p>

<p>
Public Wi-Fi is another security risk. Free Wi-Fi in cafés or libraries is convenient, but these networks are often not
secure. Students should avoid logging into important accounts when using public Wi-Fi.
</p>

<h2>Ethical Issues in Creating and Sharing Media</h2>

<p>
Ethical behavior online means being respectful and responsible. One common issue is sharing photos or videos of others
without their permission. Even if it seems harmless, it can cause embarrassment or emotional harm.
</p>

<p>
Plagiarism is another ethical issue. Copying text or images without giving credit is unfair and can lead to academic
consequences. Students should respect other people’s work and cite sources when needed.
</p>

<p>
AI-generated content creates new ethical challenges. While AI tools can be helpful, fake images or videos can spread
misinformation or harm someone’s reputation.
</p>

<p>
Sharing information without checking if it is true is also unethical. On social media, false information can spread very
quickly.
</p>

<h2>The Impact of Social Media</h2>

<p>
Social media helps students stay connected, but it can also create pressure and affect mental health. Comparing oneself to
others online can lead to stress or low self-esteem.
</p>

<h2>Why These Issues Matter to Students</h2>

<p>
Students rely on technology for education and future careers. Online behavior today can affect opportunities later in
life, including college and employment.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Communication technology is powerful but comes with risks. By understanding privacy, security, and ethical issues,
students can make safer and more responsible choices online.
